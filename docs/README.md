# Documents

Store designs, decisions, research, and reference guides here. Use
[memory](../memory/README.md) for durable guidance and non-derivable context.
Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jubishop/sourdough/issues) for
implementation progress.

## Page format

Every ordinary document has a clear title, an opening summary, and one
status field:

```yaml
---
status: current
---
```

Use `draft` for a document still being developed, `current` for the current
reference or plan, `superseded` when another document replaces it, and
`archived` when it is no longer active. A current design does not prove it
has been implemented or approved. Keep superseded and archived documents
under `archive/`, with a replacement link when one exists.

Frontmatter uses one-line string values. These checks accept plain text,
JSON-style double quotes, or YAML single quotes. Only `status` is defined
for ordinary docs. README indexes do not need frontmatter. Extend the schema
deliberately if the project needs additional fields.

## Decisions and evidence

Record each accepted decision in its authoritative document before moving
to the next interview question. Include the date, the user's reason or an
established constraint, and a material tradeoff when it explains the choice.
State that a reason is unknown when it is unknown. Keep recommendations,
unanswered questions, and accepted decisions separate. Silence is not approval.

Use sources and verification dates for changing external facts when useful.
Review those facts when related work depends on them. Keep each decision in
one place and link to it elsewhere. When it changes, explain what supersedes
the old decision. Do not store interview transcripts or task checklists here.

## Organization and links

Keep small projects flat. Add `initiatives/` or `research/` when needed.
Link every active page from this index, directly or through another README
index. Remove archived pages from active indexes. Use relative Markdown file
links and ordinary Markdown heading anchors. Standard ATX and setext headings,
duplicate heading slugs, and explicit HTML `id` anchors are supported.

Generated docs can be excluded through `checks.exclude` in
`.config/knowledge.json`. Align QMD exclusions when they should not be
searched. Do not exempt hand-written pages merely to bypass failed checks.

## Active pages

- [Development workflow](development-workflow.md): setup, search, hooks,
  worktrees, diagnostics, and recovery.
- [Site and hosting](site-and-hosting.md): recipe source, public access,
  local development, and Vercel deployment.
