# Sourdough instructions

<!-- project-starter:begin -->
Project Starter manages this block; add project rules after it. Project rules
take precedence over this block and the foundation pages wherever they differ.

- Keep durable guidance and non-derivable context in [memory](memory/README.md),
  and designs, decisions, and research in [docs](docs/README.md). Before
  non-trivial work or writing memory, search with `bin/knowledge search "term"`
  or `bin/knowledge query "question" --no-rerank`, then read results with
  `bin/knowledge get <path> -l 80`. Markdown sources are authoritative.
- If configured QMD fails, tell the user immediately and attempt repair. If
  repair fails, pause knowledge-dependent work until the user approves a
  fallback; never silently substitute `rg` or direct reads. See
  [search failures](docs/foundation/knowledge-search.md#search-failures).
- Use td for work with multiple stages, interruptions, blockers, or handoffs;
  run `td usage --new-session -q` once per new context and keep handoffs
  current. See [task tracking](docs/foundation/task-tracking.md).
- Follow the [engineering policy](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md):
  fewer dependencies, red-green tests for behavior changes, flaky tests fixed
  or tracked in an issue, cohesive files and pages, checkout-isolated
  validation, and the latest stable toolchains.
- Deliver by [kind of change](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md#kinds-of-change):
  commit text, such as Markdown and AI skill prose, directly on the default
  branch without checks; commit development code, such as tests, CI, and
  tooling, directly after its checks pass; and deliver production code through
  a pull request after its checks.
- Run [checks](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md#checks) by change: the
  relevant checks while editing, and `bin/check --full` before merging or
  releasing production code unless an enforced CI gate runs it. Reuse passing
  results.
- Keep accepted decisions separate from proposals, preserve unrelated changes,
  and keep secrets and generated caches out of Git.
- Run `bin/setup` after cloning, `bin/doctor` to diagnose setup, and
  `bin/qmd-index` after uncommitted knowledge edits. Managed files listed in
  `.project-starter.json` change only through Project Starter or a recorded
  override with its reason.

## Project

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jubishop/sourdough/issues) for shared
work and acceptance criteria.

`bin/setup` also runs `bin/setup-application`, which installs the locked
application dependencies. Run `bin/check --full` after setup or foundation
changes and before a code PR or deployment; it adds `bin/check-application`:
the Python tests, typechecking, lint, and the production build. See the
[development workflow](docs/development-workflow.md).

## Complete every change

After changes, run the required checks, commit, and push to GitHub. Deploy
functionally material changes, including recipe content and UI changes, under
the [deployment policy](docs/site-and-hosting.md#when-deployment-is-required).
Documentation, comments, formatting-only edits, and other functionally
immaterial changes do not require deployment. Honor explicit instructions to
deploy or stop before delivery steps. Preserve unrelated work and include
only authorized changes in the commit.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
